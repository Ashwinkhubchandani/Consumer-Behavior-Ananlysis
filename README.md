# Consumer-Behavior-Ananlysis
Consumer Behavior Analysis Analyzed customer purchasing data using Excel to identify sales trends, customer distribution, and brand performance through interactive dashboards. Project datasets were stored and managed in AWS S3 cloud storage, enabling centralized and scalable data access.

The analysis was performed using Excel features such as PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and timelines, which enable interactive exploration of the data. Key performance indicators (KPIs) including total sales, customer count, brand-wise performance, city-wise sales, and vehicle-type trends were derived from the dataset and visualized through an interactive Excel dashboard. These dashboards allow users to dynamically filter data and quickly identify patterns across regions, brands, and time periods.

The project dataset is organized using a fact and dimension table structure, similar to real-world analytical systems. This modeling approach improves clarity, scalability, and analytical efficiency, making it easier to perform aggregations and comparisons across multiple dimensions such as date, city, brand, and vehicle type.

All project datasets were stored and managed in AWS S3 cloud storage, providing centralized, scalable, and reliable data access. Using AWS S3 simulates an enterprise-level data storage environment and demonstrates practical exposure to cloud-based data management practices commonly used in analytics workflows.
